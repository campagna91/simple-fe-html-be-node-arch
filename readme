## SIMPLE NODE SERVER

A simple server written in node.js useful for the rapid development of small web services.

## Prerequisities

It needs to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) onto your machine
(the package from the official website also will include the npm package utility.

## Installation

From the root project's directory run the command:

```bash
> npm install
```

## Usage

After that on the project run run the command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on the port specified in the file _index.js_ .

## IDE

The project was tested using programming as a programming ideal [Visual Code Studio] (https://code.visualstudio.com/). The download and the use of the following Plugins is recommended:

1. (esformatter)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-esformatter]
2. (Style formatter)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dweber019.vscode-style-formatter]

## Debug

In order to debug the server of your project, the file in the path 

> .vscode/launch.json

provide 2 kinds of debugging types: 

**Local**

The configuration `Local Debug` allows to debug locally the server project. To start it, just select it from the dropdown menu in the `Run and Debug` side menu and press play. 

```
{
    "type": "node",
    "name": "Local Debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/index.js",
    "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk"
    ],
    "request": "attach",
    "port": 8888,
    "address": "0.0.0.0",
    "restart": true,
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
    "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
    ]
}
```

**Remote**

The configuration `Remote Debug` allows to debug locally the server project. To start it, just select it from the dropdown menu in the `Run and Debug` side menu and press play. 

```
{
    "address": "0.0.0.0",
    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "name": "Remote Debug",
    "port": 9229,
    "remoteRoot": "path/to/your/project",
    "request": "attach",
    "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
    ],
    "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk"
    ],
    "type": "pwa-node"
}
```

Remember to change the _remoteRoot_ configuration. 
Your host service configuration can differ from the above configuration so consult it in case of problems.

**IMPORTANT NOTES** 

The debugging starts on a different port.
